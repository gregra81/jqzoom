jQzoom Evolution Library - Javascript Image magnifier
======

JQZoom is a javascript image magnifier built at the top of the popular jQuery javascript framework. jQzoom is a great and a really easy to use script to magnify what you want.

It was not developed by me, this is the source: http://www.mind-projects.it/projects/jqzoom/

The only reason it is here is to be available through bower
